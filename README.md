With a past of racial inequality in the southern states it would be interesting to examine how race/ethnicity is related to access to the internet and other technologies and how not having or having access could effect a persons earnings. This can be explored via the following research questions:

  1. In the state of Alabama, how to earnings vary by access to the internet/technology?
  2. Does the internet/technology premium vary by race and ethnicity?
